# tmux configuration file for v1.7+
#
# tmux FAQ: http://sourceforge.net/p/tmux/tmux-code/ci/master/tree/FAQ
#
# Basic usage:
#   tmux          - Launch a new session.
#   tmux attach   - Attach to a previously detached session.
#   C-x d         - Detach session.
#
# Shortcuts for working with panes:
#   C-x .         - Switch to next pane (will cycle back to pane 0)
#   C-x C-Right   - Move vertical partition to the right (Resize panes).
#   C-x C-Left    - Move vertical partition to the left (Resize panes).
#   C-x s         - Toggle synchronization of panes. Very useful when
#                   comparing too files side by side.
#   C-x =         - Change pane layout to equal width and vertical.
#
